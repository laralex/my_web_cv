Known issues:
- No chapters content
   - publication WACV 2024
   - project web-site
   - project trees-ruler
- Demos overall:
   - fullscreen with F11 is weird (js error in firefox)
   - dynamic resolution confgurable per demo / pixel budget of the screen
   - frame lock is weird
   - standalone app without wasm (for faster debugging)
      - frame lock is weird
      - compiles for eternity
      - mouse events
   - simple draw abstractions:
      - blit texture
      - axes
      - lines
      - dots
      - text from premade atlas
   - demo panic - progress bar gets stuck
   - debug render mode (maybe visualize demo state in JS)
      - frame idx
      - fps
      - avg fps
      - triangle count
      - vertex count
      - resolution
      - debug mode 
- Demos:
   - frame prediction
   - fractal with high precision (perturbation)
   - water
   - deferred rendering
   - webXR (VR fractal)
   - gaussian splatting
   - animated avatar (neural net)
   - procedural generation
- Mobile layout
- Sometimes English font is not loaded
